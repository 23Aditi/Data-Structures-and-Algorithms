# Heap Sort Algorithm - Explanation

Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure. It is an efficient algorithm with a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array. It works by first building a max-heap or a min-heap and then repeatedly extracting the maximum (or minimum) element to produce a sorted array.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Heap Data Structure**
   - A heap is a complete binary tree where each node follows the **heap property**:
     - **Max-Heap**: In a max-heap, the value of each parent node is greater than or equal to the values of its children.
     - **Min-Heap**: In a min-heap, the value of each parent node is smaller than or equal to the values of its children.
     
   - A heap is represented as an array. For an element at index \(i\):
     - The left child is at index \(2i + 1\).
     - The right child is at index \(2i + 2\).
     - The parent is at index \(\left\lfloor \frac{i - 1}{2} \right\rfloor\).

### 2. **Heap Sort Algorithm**
Heap Sort works in two main phases:
   - **Building the heap**: Convert the array into a valid heap.
   - **Sorting the heap**: Repeatedly extract the root (max or min) and adjust the heap.

### 3. **Steps Involved in Heap Sort**

#### Step 1: **Build the Heap**
   - First, transform the array into a **max-heap**. This is done by "heapifying" the array starting from the last non-leaf node (index \(n/2 - 1\)) down to the root (index 0). This process ensures that the heap property is maintained throughout the tree.

#### Step 2: **Extract the Maximum Element**
   - After building the heap, the largest element will always be at the root of the heap (index 0).
   - Swap the root with the last element in the array.
   - Decrease the size of the heap by 1 (ignore the last element as it is now sorted).
   - Heapify the root to restore the heap property.

#### Step 3: **Repeat**
   - Continue the process of extracting the root, swapping it with the last element, and heapifying the root until the entire array is sorted.

### 4. **Heapify**
Heapify is a process used to maintain the heap property. It takes an element at index \(i\) and ensures that the subtree rooted at index \(i\) satisfies the heap property. If necessary, the element is swapped with its largest child and the process continues recursively until the subtree satisfies the heap property.

### 5. **Time Complexity**
   - **Build Heap**: The process of building the heap takes \(O(n)\) time.
   - **Extracting the Maximum**: Each extraction involves heapifying the root, which takes \(O(\log n)\) time. Since there are \(n\) elements, the total time for extraction is \(O(n \log n)\).
   
Thus, the overall time complexity of Heap Sort is \(O(n \log n)\), which is optimal for comparison-based sorting algorithms.

### 6. **Space Complexity**
   - Heap Sort operates in-place, meaning it doesn't require additional space for another array. The space complexity is \(O(1)\), apart from the input array.

### 7. **Advantages of Heap Sort**
   - **Efficient Time Complexity**: It guarantees \(O(n \log n)\) time complexity for sorting.
   - **In-place Sorting**: It doesnâ€™t require additional memory other than the input array.
   - **No Worst-Case Scenario**: Unlike QuickSort, which has a worst-case time complexity of \(O(n^2)\), Heap Sort guarantees \(O(n \log n)\) even in the worst case.

### 8. **Disadvantages of Heap Sort**
   - **Not Stable**: Heap Sort is not a stable sort, meaning equal elements may not retain their original relative order after sorting.
   - **Poor Cache Performance**: The heap data structure is not cache-friendly due to the nature of the heap operations.

### Example: Heap Sort (Max-Heap)

Let's sort the following array using Heap Sort:

```
Array: [4, 10, 3, 5, 1]
```

#### Step 1: **Build Max-Heap**
   After building the max-heap, the array becomes:
   ```
   [10, 5, 3, 4, 1]
   ```

#### Step 2: **Extract Maximum (Root) and Heapify**
   Swap the root (10) with the last element (1) and heapify the root:
   ```
   [1, 5, 3, 4, 10]
   ```
   After heapifying the root, the array becomes:
   ```
   [5, 4, 3, 1, 10]
   ```

#### Step 3: **Repeat**
   Continue extracting the maximum and heapifying:
   ```
   [1, 4, 3, 5, 10] --> [4, 1, 3, 5, 10] --> [3, 1, 4, 5, 10] --> [1, 3, 4, 5, 10]
   ```

#### Step 4: **Final Sorted Array**
   The final sorted array is:
   ```
   [1, 3, 4, 5, 10]
   ```

## Conclusion

Heap Sort is a powerful and efficient sorting algorithm with \(O(n \log n)\) time complexity. It is particularly useful for applications where space complexity is crucial since it sorts the elements in place. However, it is not stable and has poor cache performance.
